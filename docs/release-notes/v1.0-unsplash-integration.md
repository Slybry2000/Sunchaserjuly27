## üîß Technical Implementation

### **New Backend Endpoints**

#### `POST /internal/photos/track`
```json
{
  "download_location": "https://api.unsplash.com/photos/abc123/download",
  "photo_id": "abc123"
}
```
**Response**: `{"tracked": true}` or `{"tracked": false}`
**Features**: TTL deduplication, Unsplash compliance, error handling

#### `GET /internal/photos/meta?photo_id=abc123`
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "urls": {
    "regular": "https://images.unsplash.com/abc123?auto=format&fit=crop"
  },
  "links": {
    "download_location": "https://api.unsplash.com/photos/abc123/download"
  },
  "attribution_html": "Photo by <a href='...'>Photographer</a> on <a href='...'>Unsplash</a>"
}
```

### **New Services & Infrastructure**

#### `Backend/services/unsplash_integration.py`
- `trigger_photo_download()`: Unsplash API download tracking
- `build_attribution_html()`: Proper photographer crediting
- Full unit test coverage with mocked external calls

#### `Backend/scripts/integration_smoke.py`  
- End-to-end API flow validation (meta ‚Üí track ‚Üí dedupe)
- CI integration with `--mock-trigger` and `--wait` options
- Production safety with secret header validation

### **Production Safety Features**

#### Environment Gating
```python
# Mock headers only allowed with proper configuration
ALLOW_TEST_HEADERS = os.environ.get('ALLOW_TEST_HEADERS', 'false') == 'true'
UNSPLASH_TEST_HEADER_SECRET = os.environ.get('UNSPLASH_TEST_HEADER_SECRET')

# Production prevents accidental mock usage
if not ALLOW_TEST_HEADERS:
    # Mock headers ignored in production
```

#### Security Hardening
- **Environment Variables**: `UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID` for production API access
- **CI Secrets**: `UNSPLASH_TEST_HEADER_SECRET` for automated testing
- **Audit Logging**: All photo tracking logged with request IDs
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
```bash
# All new functionality fully tested
pytest Backend/tests/test_unsplash_integration.py     # Unit tests
pytest Backend/tests/test_unsplash_router.py          # API integration tests
python Backend/scripts/integration_smoke.py          # End-to-end validation
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline Status: ‚úÖ ALL PASSING**
1. **Python Tests**: All backend unit and integration tests
2. **Integration Smoke**: End-to-end API flow with mock security
3. **Lint & Type**: Code quality enforcement (Ruff + MyPy)
4. **Flutter CI**: Frontend analysis and widget testing
5. **Security**: Production safety and environment validation

### **Performance Validation**
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate Unsplash API calls (TTL configurable)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with proper error responses
- **Monitoring**: Metrics for success/failure rates and response times
