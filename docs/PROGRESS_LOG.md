# Progress Log

## 2025-09-18

### Completed
- Recreated the virtual environment with Python 3.11 and reinstalled dependencies.
- VS Code configured to use `.venv` (3.11) and improved analysis (Pylance/Pyright, Ruff).
- CI: Integration smoke workflow aligned to Python 3.11.
- Quality gates: Ruff clean, mypy clean, 90 tests passed (4 skipped).

### Notes
- Prior Problems panel noise was due to Python version mismatch; aligning to 3.11 quiets false diagnostics.

### Next
- Ensure all contributors use Python 3.11 locally.
- Validate fresh clone path on a clean machine (clone → venv 3.11 → install → pytest).
- Add pre-commit hooks for Ruff, Mypy, and basic tests.
- Open a PR summarizing environment and CI alignment.
