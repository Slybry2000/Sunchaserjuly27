## Application Materials

### üìù Application Description
```
Application Name: Sun Chaser

Description: Sun Chaser is a mobile application that helps outdoor enthusiasts 
discover hiking trails, parks, lakes, and other recreational locations in the 
Pacific Northwest. The app provides weather-aware recommendations for outdoor 
activities based on user location and preferences.

We use Unsplash's API to display high-quality landscape photography that 
represents the natural beauty of recommended locations. All photos are properly 
attributed to their photographers and link back to Unsplash as required.

Key Features:
- Location-based outdoor recreation recommendations
- Weather integration for activity planning  
- High-quality location photography via Unsplash API
- Proper photographer attribution and Unsplash crediting

Expected Usage: Approximately 1,000-2,000 photo requests per day as users 
browse location recommendations. Photos are cached on device to minimize 
repeated requests for the same content.

We are committed to following all Unsplash API guidelines and providing 
proper attribution to photographers while driving traffic back to Unsplash.
```

// 2. Download Tracking - Required for every photo view
Future<void> trackPhotoUsage(UnsplashPhoto photo) async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse(photo.links.downloadLocation),
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Client-ID $accessKey'},
  );
}

// 3. Proper Attribution - Required on every photo
Widget buildAttribution(UnsplashPhoto photo) {
  return Text.rich(
    TextSpan(
      children: [
        TextSpan(text: 'Photo by '),
        TextSpan(
          text: photo.user.name,
          style: TextStyle(decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
          recognizer: TapGestureRecognizer()
            ..onTap = () => launchUrl(photo.user.links.html),
        ),
        TextSpan(text: ' on '),
        TextSpan(
          text: 'Unsplash',
          style: TextStyle(decoration: TextDecoration.underline),
          recognizer: TapGestureRecognizer()
            ..onTap = () => launchUrl(photo.links.html),
