## Application Information

**Application Name**: Sun Chaser  
**Website**: https://github.com/Slybry2000/Sunchaserjuly27  
**Contact Email**: [Provide your email]  
**Expected Usage**: 1,000-2,000 photo requests per day  

## Application Description

Sun Chaser is a mobile application that helps outdoor enthusiasts discover hiking trails, parks, lakes, and other recreational locations in the Pacific Northwest. The app provides weather-aware recommendations for outdoor activities based on user location and current weather conditions.

We use Unsplash's API to display high-quality landscape photography that represents the natural beauty of recommended locations. All photos are properly attributed to their photographers and link back to Unsplash as required.

**Key Features:**
- Location-based outdoor recreation recommendations
- Weather integration for activity planning with Sun Confidence scoring
- High-quality location photography via Unsplash API
- Proper photographer attribution and Unsplash crediting
- Download tracking for all photo views as required

**Expected Usage**: Approximately 1,000-2,000 photo requests per day as users browse location recommendations. Photos are hotlinked directly from Unsplash URLs and never cached locally.

We are committed to following all Unsplash API guidelines and providing proper attribution to photographers while driving traffic back to Unsplash.

## Technical Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Download Tracking Implementation
```
Backend Endpoint: POST /internal/photos/track
- Accepts download_location from Unsplash photo metadata
- Calls Unsplash download endpoint to register usage
- Implements deduplication to prevent duplicate tracking
- Returns tracking success status to client
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
```

### ✅ Photo Hotlinking Implementation  
```
Backend Endpoint: GET /internal/photos/meta
- Returns Unsplash photo URLs for direct hotlinking
- Provides photo.urls.regular for full-size display
- Provides photo.urls.small for thumbnails
- Never stores or caches Unsplash images locally
- Includes proper photo metadata and links
```

### ✅ Attribution Implementation
```
Server-side Attribution Helper:
- Generates proper "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash" format
- Photographer name links to their Unsplash profile
- "Unsplash" text links to photo's Unsplash page
- Attribution visible on every photo display
- Includes proper HTML formatting for web rendering
```

### ✅ Production Safety & Security
```
Environment Protection:
- Mock testing gated by ALLOW_TEST_HEADERS environment variable
- CI testing uses UNSPLASH_TEST_HEADER_SECRET for validation
- Production deployment prevents accidental test header usage
- Comprehensive logging and audit trail for all usage
- Rate limiting and error handling for API failures
```

---

## Code Examples

### Backend API Integration
```python
# Download tracking implementation
@router.post("/internal/photos/track")
async def track_photo_view(payload: TrackPayload):
    download_location = payload.download_location
    photo_id = payload.photo_id
    
    if download_location and ACCESS_KEY:
        success = await trigger_photo_download(download_location, ACCESS_KEY)
        return {"tracked": success}
    else:
        return {"tracked": False}

# Attribution helper
def build_attribution_html(photo: dict) -> str:
    photographer = photo['user']['name']
    photographer_url = photo['user']['links']['html']
    photo_url = photo['links']['html']
    
    return f'Photo by <a href="{photographer_url}">{photographer}</a> on <a href="{photo_url}">Unsplash</a>'
```

### Frontend Integration Pattern
```dart
// Hotlinking implementation
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: photo.urls.regular, // Direct Unsplash URL
  // Never download or cache the actual image file
)

// Download tracking implementation
Future<void> trackPhotoUsage(UnsplashPhoto photo) async {
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('/internal/photos/track'),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: jsonEncode({
      'download_location': photo.links.downloadLocation,
    }),
  );
}

// Attribution display
Widget buildAttribution(UnsplashPhoto photo) {
  return Html(data: photo.attributionHtml); // Renders clickable links
}
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Automated Testing Suite
```
CI/CD Pipeline Status: 16/16 checks passing
- Unit Tests: Backend helper functions and API endpoints
- Integration Tests: End-to-end photo meta → track → dedupe flow
- Smoke Tests: Automated API validation in CI environment
- Security Tests: Mock header validation and environment gating
- Code Quality: Linting, type checking, and formatting validation
```

### ✅ Manual Testing Verification
```
✅ Photo hotlinking verified (direct Unsplash URL usage)
✅ Download tracking verified (backend API calls Unsplash)  
✅ Attribution links verified (photographer and Unsplash pages)
✅ Deduplication verified (prevents duplicate tracking)
✅ Error handling verified (graceful failures and logging)
```

## Screenshots & Examples

### 1. Photo Attribution Example
*Screenshot showing proper "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash" attribution with clickable links*

**Implementation**: Server provides attribution HTML, frontend renders with tappable links to photographer profile and Unsplash photo page.

### 2. App Interface Distinction  
*Screenshot showing Sun Chaser's unique outdoor recreation interface*

**Verification**: App design is clearly distinct from Unsplash with focus on weather data, location recommendations, and outdoor activity planning.

### 3. Photo Integration in Location Discovery
*Screenshot showing Unsplash photos enhancing location recommendations*

**Implementation**: Photos are hotlinked from Unsplash URLs and displayed alongside weather data and Sun Confidence scores for each recommended location.

## Integration smoke usage

We provide a small integration smoke script to validate end-to-end behavior of
the Unsplash meta -> track flow against a running deployment. It can be used
locally against a dev server or in CI against a staging endpoint.

Usage:

```sh
# Run against localhost (server must be running)
python Backend/scripts/integration_smoke.py --base-url http://localhost:8000 --photo-id smoke-1 --mock-trigger --dedupe-ttl 1

# In CI, set the following repo secrets: SMOKE_BASE_URL and UNSPLASH_TEST_HEADER_SECRET
# Then trigger the GitHub Actions workflow `Integration Smoke - Unsplash Tracking`
```

The script performs:
- GET /internal/photos/meta?photo_id={id}
- POST /internal/photos/track with download_location from meta
- POST /internal/photos/track again to assert dedupe
- If `--dedupe-ttl` is provided, waits TTL+0.1s and POSTs again to assert TTL expiry

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/integration-smoke.yml`
that runs this script against a configured `SMOKE_BASE_URL` and expects the CI
secret `UNSPLASH_TEST_HEADER_SECRET` to be present for the `--mock-trigger` flow.


## Post-Approval Implementation Plan

### Phase 2: Monitoring & Analytics (Days 2-3)
1. Set up production dashboards for API usage
2. Implement alerts for rate limiting or failures
3. Monitor photo tracking success rates
4. Validate attribution link click-through

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Week 1)
