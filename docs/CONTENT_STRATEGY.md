# Sun Chaser Content Strategy
## Unsplash API Integration & Production Photo Management

### üìä Current Status
- **Total Locations**: 103 
- **Categories**: 11 types (Mountain, Lake, Park, Gorge, Climbing, Island, Beach, Trail, Forest, Desert, Urban Park)
- **Geographic Focus**: 56 WA + 47 OR locations
- **Technical Status**: LocationImageService implemented with category-based fallbacks

### üéØ Strategic Approach

#### Phase 1: Unsplash API Integration (1-2 weeks)
**Goal**: Replace category-based images with location-specific Unsplash photos

**Implementation**:
1. **Unsplash API Setup**
   - Register for Unsplash Developer Account
   - Implement search API for location-specific queries
   - Build photo selection algorithm (relevance + quality scoring)
   - Add proper attribution system

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Hotlink photos to original Unsplash URLs (required for production)
   - Implement download endpoint triggers when users view photos
   - Add photographer attribution: "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash" with links
   - Ensure visual distinction from Unsplash interface

3. **Benefits**:
   - ‚úÖ High-quality, relevant location photos
   - ‚úÖ No upfront photo acquisition costs
   - ‚úÖ Vast library of outdoor recreation imagery
   - ‚úÖ Automatic attribution and licensing compliance

#### Phase 2: Production Application (1 week)
**Goal**: Apply for Unsplash production access (5,000 requests/hour)

**Production Checklist**:
- [ ] **Photo Hotlinking**: Photos must hotlink to original Unsplash URLs
- [ ] **Download Tracking**: Trigger download endpoint when users view photos  
- [ ] **No Unsplash Branding**: App name/design distinct from Unsplash
- [ ] **Proper Attribution**: "Photo by [Photographer] on Unsplash" with links
- [ ] **Accurate Description**: Clear app purpose and functionality for review
- [ ] **Screenshots**: Show proper attribution implementation

**Application Process**:
1. Review Unsplash API guidelines thoroughly
2. Prepare application materials (screenshots, descriptions)
3. Submit production application
4. Implement any required changes based on feedback

#### Phase 3: User-Generated Content (Future Release)
**Goal**: Allow community photo contributions
*Note: This will be implemented in a later version*

**Planned Features**:
- User photo upload system
- Community moderation and approval workflow  
- Photo rating and quality scoring
- Integration with existing Unsplash content
- Seasonal photo variations and updates
