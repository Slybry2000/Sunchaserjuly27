# Development Runbook

This file documents environment setup, development commands, and the production-ready Unsplash API integration.

## ‚úÖ Current Development Status - Production Ready

‚úÖ **Backend**: Production-ready with 16/16 CI checks passing  
‚úÖ **Frontend**: Flutter app complete with weather integration  
‚úÖ **Photos**: **Unsplash API integration complete** with production safety  
‚úÖ **CI/CD**: Full automation with GitHub Actions pipeline  
üéØ **Next**: Submit Unsplash production API application

## üì∏ Photo Integration - Production Complete

### ‚úÖ **Unsplash API Implementation Status**
- **‚úÖ Backend API**: Complete with `/internal/photos/meta` and `/internal/photos/track`
- **‚úÖ Download Tracking**: Deduplication and proper Unsplash compliance
- **‚úÖ Attribution System**: Server-side HTML generation with tappable links  
- **‚úÖ Production Safety**: Mock header hardening and environment gating
- **‚úÖ CI/CD Integration**: 16/16 automated tests passing
- **‚úÖ Documentation**: Complete implementation and application guides

### **Development vs Production Configuration**
```bash
# Development (without UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID)
# - Photo tracking returns tracked: false (safe fallback)
# - Attribution still works for UI development
# - Mock headers allowed with ALLOW_TEST_HEADERS=true

# Production (with UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID) 
# - Photo tracking calls Unsplash download endpoint
# - Full compliance with attribution and tracking requirements
# - Mock headers disabled for security
```

**Documentation**: See `docs/UNSPLASH_APPLICATION_MATERIALS.md` for production deployment details

## Feature Flags

| Flag | Purpose | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| `ENABLE_Q` | Enable the typed `?q=` geocode path on `/recommend` | `false` | Set to `true` to allow text queries in dev/staging. |
| `DEV_ALLOW_GEOCODE` | Enable developer fallback geocoding (a few hard-coded mappings) when `MAPBOX_TOKEN` is not present | `false` | |
| `DEV_BYPASS_SCORING` | DEV only: bypass weather scoring and return nearest candidates directly from the dataset | `false` | Useful for UI demos when upstream weather is unavailable or slow. |
| `DEV_ALLOW_CORS` | When `true`, enables permissive CORS for local frontend development | `false` | |
| `CORS_ENFORCE` | Enforce CORS allowlist; return 403 for disallowed origins | `false` | Default off for dev; set to `true` in staging/prod. |
| `CACHE_REFRESH_SYNC` | Make cache refresh synchronous for deterministic tests | `false` | Set to `true` in CI/test environments to avoid flaky cache tests. |
| `BETA_KEYS` | Comma-separated list of beta access keys | `""` | If set, require `X-Beta-Key` header for access. |

## Key env flags (legacy)

- `MAPBOX_TOKEN` ‚Äî Mapbox geocoding token for production/staging geocode. Leave empty for local dev unless you want real Mapbox lookups.

Quick examples (PowerShell)

Start the backend with permissive CORS and dev geocode fallback:

    $env:DEV_ALLOW_CORS = 'true';
    $env:DEV_ALLOW_GEOCODE = 'true';
    & .venv\Scripts\uvicorn.exe Backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

Run the staging smoke checks against a running backend (default base http://127.0.0.1:8000):

    # run smoke script
    python Backend\scripts\staging_smoke.py --base http://127.0.0.1:8000

    # run smoke script with dev scoring bypass to return nearby dataset candidates
    $env:DEV_BYPASS_SCORING='true'; python Backend\scripts\staging_smoke.py --base http://127.0.0.1:8000

Add a demo dataset row (already done in this branch): we added `Volunteer Park` and two Seattle rows (`Gas Works Park`, `Discovery Park`) to `Backend/data/pnw.csv` for local demos.

## Performance Tuning Cheat Sheet

To optimize `/recommend` performance and reduce 504 timeouts:

- `WEATHER_FANOUT_MAX_CANDIDATES`: Max locations to fetch weather for (default 20). Reduce to 12 for staging if 504s occur.
- `REQUEST_BUDGET_MS`: Overall request timeout (default 1500ms). Increase to 2000ms if needed.
- `WEATHER_FANOUT_CONCURRENCY`: Concurrent weather fetches (default 8). Reduce to 4 for lower load.

Example for staging env:
```
WEATHER_FANOUT_MAX_CANDIDATES=12
REQUEST_BUDGET_MS=2000
```

## Notes & safety

- Remove or set `DEV_BYPASS_SCORING=false` before pushing to staging/production. The dev bypass is intentionally destructive to production-like behavior (it skips weather and scoring).
- Keep `DEV_ALLOW_GEOCODE` off in staging/prod; instead, provision `MAPBOX_TOKEN` for staging to test real geocoding.
- If you see frequent 504s on `/recommend` for large radii, tune the above knobs in your environment for staging.

If you want, I can also add a short GitHub Actions workflow to run the smoke script against a staging job as a post-deploy check. Ask me to add it and I will implement a minimal workflow file.

## üö® **UPDATED FRONTEND ASSESSMENT (Critical Findings)**

After deeper inspection of the Flutter app, **Phase C is NOT complete for production launch**:

### ‚úÖ **What's Actually Working**
- Real API integration with ETag caching
- Proper error handling and telemetry  
- Clean architecture and navigation
- All analyzer checks passing

### ‚ùå **Critical Blockers for Production Launch**

1. **Image System Failure** 
   - Using `https://picsum.photos/seed/` random stock photos
   - No real photos of the 103 PNW locations
   - Will show random buildings/objects instead of actual hiking spots

2. **Dummy Data Fallback**
   - When API fails, shows fake locations like "Sunny Beach Park" 
   - Users will see non-existent places in production
   - No proper offline/error state handling

3. **Content Strategy Missing**
   - 103 locations need real photography
   - Location descriptions are auto-generated placeholders
   - No content management system

### üéØ **Revised Production Timeline**

**‚úÖ COMPLETED (Sept 3, 2025)**: Frontend reliability improvements
   - Removed dummy data fallback behavior
   - Proper error handling when API unavailable
   - Category-based curated images (Unsplash)
   - Loading indicators and better UX

**Immediate (1-2 days)**: ~~Fix API fallback behavior~~ ‚úÖ DONE
**Short-term (1-2 weeks)**: Acquire real location photos  
**Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**: Content management and photo integration

**Current Status**: Backend production-ready, Frontend connectivity-ready, needs content work

---

## ‚úÖ **PROGRESS UPDATE: Frontend Improvements Complete**

**What We Just Fixed:**
1. **üö® Dummy Data Problem**: Eliminated fake "Sunny Beach Park" fallbacks
2. **üñºÔ∏è Image Quality**: Upgraded from random photos to category-specific curated images
3. **üì± User Experience**: Proper loading states and error messages
4. **üîå Connectivity**: Honest offline behavior instead of misleading content

**Impact**: Users now get reliable, honest feedback instead of confusing dummy data.
