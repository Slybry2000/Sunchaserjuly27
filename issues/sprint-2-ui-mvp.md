Title: Sprint 2 — UI MVP

Body:

Tasks:
- Build minimal Flutter/FlutterFlow screens: Home (input) and Results (list)
- Wire UI to dummy data first; implement models for `RecommendResponse`
- Implement radius and date selectors; basic client-side filtering
- Add simple navigation and basic styling

Acceptance criteria:
- App can show dummy results and navigate between screens
- Models match backend contract (v1) for quick integration
- Basic user flows are testable

Notes:
- Later sprints will integrate live data and ETag/304 client behavior.
